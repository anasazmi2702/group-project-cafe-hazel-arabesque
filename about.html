            <p> Coffee Brewing Techniques </p>
            <p> "Baristas must have a deep understanding of various coffee brewing methods, including espresso machines, pour-over, French press, Aeropress, and more. They need to know how to grind coffee beans, adjust grind settings, and control extraction times to achieve the desired flavor profiles." </p>

            <p> Milk Frothing and Latte Art: </p>
            <p> "Many coffee beverages involve steamed milk, and baristas need to be proficient in frothing milk to different consistencies. Latte art, which involves creating designs on the surface of the coffee using steamed milk, is also a common skill that enhances the visual appeal of drinks." </p>
